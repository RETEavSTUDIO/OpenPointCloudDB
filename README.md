# OpenPointCloudDB
Open cloud db is an open source project that provides users with the ability to upload, download, and store point cloud data.
Anyone can download the data for subsequent temporal analysis. All data is georeferenced. Data compatible with qgis, open street map etc (See format compatibility page)
This page is not a real data store and only serves to represent the directory structure.
And in general, this is my project for the university, please do not beat with sticks.
